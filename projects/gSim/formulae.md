# Explanation for gSim formulae

The fundamental formula behind gSim is based on two formulae:

$$F=ma$$

$$F=G\frac{m_1m_2}{d^2}$$

Naturally, then, it is given that:

$$m_1a = G\frac{m_1m_2}{d^2}$$

$$a = \frac{G\frac{m_1m_2}{d^2}}{m_1}$$

$$a = \frac{Gm_2}{d^2}$$

where $d$ is the distance between the two mass particles, calculated using Pythagoras' formula:

$$d = \sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2+(y_1-y_2)^2}$$
