        Hi there! <a href="https://masonx.ca/">My name is Mason</a>.
        Over the course of the school year, I've done a bit of art work.<br/ >
        Here's a gallery consisting of some of the more notable things I've done.<br />
        This gallery is also available in the form of a slideshow <a href=".">here</a>.<br/>

        I enjoy art and I like designing things.
        Often, I have trouble coming up with ideas for my projects.
        Most of the time, however, I end up stumbling upon something... idiosyncratic.
        Personally, my artwork reflects this quirkiness - traffic cones, ducks, and symbols of the illuminati are not something you'd see in a gallery next to each other, normally.

        My preferred medium of drawing is something that you can make mistakes on, since I make a lot of them.
        As a result, I really like acrylic paints (where you just paint over your mistakes), computer modeling/drawing (where undoing is just a press of a button),  and pencils (where you just erase your mistakes).
        I am working to improve with other forms, though (such as watercolour), since I don't like to limit myself.<br /><br />
        I also really enjoy rubbing graphite, since I find the smoothness of the result really pleasing :)
