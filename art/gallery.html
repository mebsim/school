        <div class="desc">
        Hi there! <a href="https://masonx.ca/">My name is Mason</a>.
        Over the course of the school year, I've done a bit of art work.<br/ >
        Here's a gallery consisting of some of the more notable things I've done.<br />
        This gallery is also available in the form of a slideshow <a href=".">here</a>.<br/>
        <br/ >
        I enjoy art and I like designing things.
        Often, I have trouble coming up with ideas for my projects.
        Most of the time, however, I end up stumbling upon something... idiosyncratic.
        Personally, my artwork reflects this quirkiness - traffic cones, ducks, and symbols of the illuminati are not something you'd see in a gallery next to each other, normally.
        <br />
        <br />
        My preferred medium of drawing is something that you can make mistakes on, since I make a lot of them.
        As a result, I really like acrylic paints (where you just paint over your mistakes), computer modeling/drawing (where undoing is just a press of a button),  and pencils (where you just erase your mistakes).
        I am working to improve with other forms, though (such as watercolour), since I don't like to limit myself.<br /><br />
        I also really enjoy rubbing graphite, since I find the smoothness of the result really pleasing :)

        <h1>Reflection</h1>
        <div class="desc">
My artwork typically tends to have little relationship between pieces (since they're mostly just "random" ideas of mine), so typically there is not really a theme.
However, what the human mind perceives as random does tend to have patterns sometimes, and this year, there is one: Quirkiness.
Many of my ideas are random, and I suppose them being random is a theme.
To me, this represents me fairly well: I, myself, tend to come up with random ideas in other classes, too.
I identify with this random style, so I like artwork from people such as Jackson Pollock, who paint
with this same "random" style, but end up looking not too bad.
<br />
<br />
I feel that shape/form is the element used the most in my compositions since it plays a very important
role in making things look realistic. A lot of the time, too, I use the contrast and emphasis principles of design to bring
out the important subjects of my artwork. Many of my pieces reflect these elements and principles, whether it's my brightly coloured
traffic cone or my carefully shaded duck. At the start of the year, these were mostly the same as well.
I feel like I developed most of the basics of artwork already, including my preferred elements and principles of design.
I still do have room to improve, though.
<br />
<br />
I used a variety of tools and materials this year, ranging from graphite pencils, to acrylic paint, to computers, to watercolour, to coloured pencils.
Personally, my most favourite would probably be graphite pencils.
My main technique with them is to layer on shades and get darker eventually, and also use tissues to rub the graphite smoother.
To me, the end result looks really nice, and you don't even need to put much effort into it.
Later on, near the end of the year, when I started documenting my process work more, I started learning
a lot more about the process behind completing a work of art. Starting with the idea, an artist
must slowly develop the drawing from rough ideas to a more fine-tuned piece of artwork.
As well, while the process of a piece of art can vary a lot based on the medium, 
they all tend to include a lot of planning behind it.
<br />
<br />
I developed a lot of my drawing art skills, but the area where I feel like I improved the most is
with watercolours. I started off being terrible, and then I ended up a lot better. This takeaway
of not being scared of trying different things is something that I will remember from this course.
By learning and exploring new things, and improving on things I'm bad at, I feel like I
can become a better artist.
<br />
<br />
If I could start this course again, I would probably re-do my sketchbook cover (since I feel like I could improve a lot with that),
and I would probably document my process better. I only really documented my process with my last project, so I was not prepared to
explain everything at the end of the year. Also, if you document your process, you can improve more with each project.
I would totally give this advice to new Grade 9 art students, too.
Nonetheless, even without documenting, I feel that, overall, I improved as an artist.
I now have a better understanding of the things that go on behind a piece of artwork, and 
more appreciation for art in general.
